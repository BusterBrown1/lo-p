<P>This page explains how to get the
"Java LibreOffice Programming" code
examples to work. There are three main steps: 
<ol>
<li>download LibreOffice <b>and</b> other Java libraries,</li>
<li>download my utility classes, and</li>
<li>download the chapter examples.</li>
</ol>
</P>

<P>I've only tested my code on Windows machines, so
this page will limit itself to that platform.</P><br>



<H2>1. Downloading LibreOffice and Other libraries</H2>

<P>
<ul>
  <li>Check if your machine is 64-bit or 32-bit (e.g. by calling <tt>systeminfo</tt>
  from the command line, and looking at the "System Type" entry). If you
  have a 64-bit machine then you'll have to decide whether to download the
  64-bit or 32-bit versions of the JDK and LibreOffice, but make sure
  the pair you choose have the same "bitness". If you've got a 32-bit
  machine, then you'll have to get the 32-bit pair of JDK and LibreOffice.
  </li><br>

  <li>Download a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">Java SE Development Kit</a> (JDK).
  The Java site uses "x86" as another name for 32-bit.
  Install it in its default position on your machine. Add the
  full directory path holding
  the Java compiler and runtime executables to Window's <tt>PATH</tt> 
  environment variable.
  The directory path typically ends with <tt>Java\jdk1.8.0_XXX\bin</tt>.</li><br>


  <li>Download <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>. 
  Install it in its default position on your machine. Add the full directory path
  containing
  the LibreOffice executable (<tt>soffice.exe</tt>) to Window's <tt>PATH</tt> 
  environment variable. 
  The directory path typically ends with <tt>LibreOffice 5/program</tt>.<br>
  By the way, there are two versions of LibreOffice to choose from, called
  'still' and 'fresh'. I usually download 'fresh', but the 'still' version is
  available <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-still/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  By the way, if you want to download LibreOffice version 4 instead of the new
  version 5, that's fine as well.
  </li><br>


  <li>Download the <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/" target="_blank">SDK</a>
  from the same webpage as LibreOffice (for Windows, it's an MSI file). 
  There's no need to get
  the source code. The installed SDK will appear
  as an <tt>sdk</tt> subdirectory in the LibreOffice directory.
  Optionally download the built in Help as well, but LibreOffice will
  default to using the online version if Help isn't installed.  </li><br>
 

  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/twall/jna" target="_blank">JNA</a>. 
  There are two files to download (<tt>jna.jar</tt> and 
  <tt>jna-platform.jar</tt>) which are listed 
  in the <b>Download</b> section some way down the JNA webpage.
  Install these files in the directory <tt>D:\jna</tt> on your machine. This
  location is used by my compile and run batch files.</li><br>
</ul>
</P>
<br>


<H2>2. Installing my Utility Classes</H2>

<P>The utility classes are in a folder <tt>Utils</tt>, which can be downloaded
as a <a href="code/utils.zip">zipped file</a>. It should be unzipped and placed in a
new subdirectory for your LibreOffice programs. This directory can be called
anything; mine is called <tt>LibreOffice Tests</tt>.
</P>
<br>

<H2>3. Installing my Examples</H2>

<P>Links going to the zipped examples can be found in the chapter sections
on the <a href="index-2.html">main page of this site</a></P>

<P>Download the zip file, extract the directory (e.g. <tt>Writer Tests</tt>), and store
in the same directory as the one holding the <tt>Utils</tt> directory 
(e.g. in <tt>LibreOffice Tests</tt>). This organization is used
by my compile and run batch files. There is a <tt>readme.txt</tt> file in each
directory, explaining how to compile and run the examples.</P><br>
