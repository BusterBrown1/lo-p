# Preface

Star Basic is the native language of Star Office which has been incorporated by Open Office and Libre Office. This means that all other supported languages must negotiate a basic bridge.

This [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64517979) from Dan Dascalescu offers a challenge to the community:

> _after 20 years of software development, the LibreOffice API is the crappiest one I've had the "pleasure" of working with. The documentation is [horrible](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1util_1_1SearchDescriptor.html), spread all over the place, [littered with Uyghur](https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=166685), or [completely missing](https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/98257/javascript-macro-reference/). The LibreOffice macro IDE is also extremely unhelpful._

LibreOffice Programming offers a framework for the community to take another step to change this. The starting point is [Java LibreOffice Programming](https://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jlop/) which we thank Andrew Davison for kindly making available provided his work is acknowledged. Since Java is not Basic it provides good insight into using non-Basic languages even if the language is different.

Changes required are reformatting for this media since the scripts have missed a lot of detail including code, generalising the content so it is more widely applicable to supported languages and complementing Java examples with examples of other language. Please contribute where you can.

# Overview

!![[Java LibreOffice Programming]](images/jLo.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><img src="/images/jLo.png"/></div>

_Java LibreOffice Programming_ (JLOP) is intended for programmers who want to learn how to use the Java version of the [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) API. This allows Java to control and manipulate LibreOffice's text, drawing, presentation, spreadsheet, and database applications, and a lot more (e.g. its spell checker, forms designer, and charting tools).

This book is **not** about how to use LibreOffice's GUI. I won't explain where to find a particular menu item to change text colour or run the spell checker. But I **will** explain how to do these kinds of things via API calls from Java programs. For instance, I describe a program that constructs a Word file full of randomly generated algebra questions, and show how a ASCII text file can be transformed into a slide presentation.

Although most of the examples are Java programs that call the LibreOffice API, I briefly look at other kinds of programming, such as Java macros and new LibreOffice functionality, accessible via menu items or as spreadsheet functions, and the dispatching of commands to the GUI.

One of my aims was to develop utility code to help flatten the steep learning curve for the API. For example, my Lo class simplifies the steps needed to initialize the API (by creating a connection to a LibreOffice process), to open/create a document, save it, and close down LibreOffice.

Another aim was to have my code work on LibreOffice **and** [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/), which isn't difficult since their APIs are nearly identical. However, I must admit that at this stage I've restricted myself to testing the programs only on LibreOffice, and only on MS Windows.
