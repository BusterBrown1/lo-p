Star Basic is the native language of Star Office which has been incorporated by Open Office and Libre Office. This means that all other supported languages must negotiate a basic bridge.

This [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64517979) from Dan Dascalescu is a challenge to the community:

> _after 20 years of software development, the LibreOffice API is the crappiest one I've had the "pleasure" of working with. The documentation is [horrible](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1util_1_1SearchDescriptor.html), spread all over the place, [littered with Uyghur](https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=166685), or [completely missing](https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/98257/javascript-macro-reference/). The LibreOffice macro IDE is also extremely unhelpful._

[LibreOffice Programming](https://flywire.github.io/lo-p/) offers a framework for the community to take another step to change this. The starting point is [Java LibreOffice Programming](https://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jlop/) which we thank Andrew Davison for kindly making available provided his work is acknowledged. Since Java is not Basic it provides good insight into using non-Basic languages despite the languages being different.

Changes required are reformatting for this media, generalising the content so it is more widely applicable to supported languages and complementing Java examples with other language examples. Please contribute where you can.
